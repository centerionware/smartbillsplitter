        <h2>Key Features & Talking Points</h2>
        <article>
            <h3>AI Receipt Scanner</h3>
            <p>Instantly turn paper receipts into digital records. Just snap a photo, and our AI intelligently extracts every item, price, and detail, saving you from manual data entry. It's perfect for complex grocery bills or long restaurant tabs.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Ultimate Privacy & Security</h3>
            <p>Your financial data is yours alone. All bills and personal information are stored locally on your device, not in the cloud. When you share a bill, it's end-to-end encrypted, meaning we can't see it. No accounts, no sign-ups, no data harvesting.</p>

        <article>
            <h3>Flexible Splitting Options</h3>

        </article>
        <article>
            <h3>Recurring Bill Templates</h3>

        <article>
            <h3>Effortless Settlement</h3>

        </article>
         <article>
            <h3>Works Offline</h3>
