                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">How AI is Revolutionizing Expense Tracking with Receipt Scanning</h4>
                        <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-slate-700">
                            <p>The days of manually typing in every line item from a crumpled receipt are over. At SharedBills, we've integrated a powerful AI model that transforms a simple photo of a receipt into structured, actionable financial data. This isn't just basic Optical Character Recognition (OCR); our system uses a sophisticated generative model, similar to Google's Gemini, to understand the context and layout of a receipt.</p>
                            <p>The AI can distinguish between item names, prices, taxes, and totals. It correctly identifies the merchant and the date of purchase, providing a complete and accurate record of your transaction in seconds. This automation is a cornerstone of modern personal finance management, saving users time and reducing the friction associated with tracking expenses, ultimately leading to better budgeting and financial awareness.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">The Magic Behind AI-Powered CSV Importing for Financial Data</h4>
                        <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-slate-700">
                            <p>Many financially savvy individuals and small businesses rely on spreadsheets to manage their budgets. Exporting data from bank statements or other financial apps often results in CSV files with inconsistent column names and formats. Our AI-powered CSV importer tackles this problem head-on.</p>
                            <p>Instead of forcing users to meticulously rename columns to match a rigid template, our application sends the CSV content to a large language model. The AI analyzes the data and infers the meaning of each column—whether it's labeled 'Cost', 'Amount', 'Price', or 'Charge', it understands the financial intent. It intelligently groups transactions into distinct bills, identifies participants, and structures the data for seamless import. This feature dramatically lowers the barrier to entry for users wanting to migrate their financial history into SharedBills, promoting better long-term financial planning.</p>

                        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-teal-700">Balancing AI Power with User Privacy in Finance Apps</h4>
                        <div class="mt-2 space-y-4 text-slate-700">
                            <p>Financial data is among the most sensitive personal information, and user privacy is our top priority. While many apps upload your data to the cloud for processing, SharedBills employs a hybrid, privacy-first architecture. All your core financial data—bills, participants, and balances—is stored exclusively on your device within your browser's secure storage.</p>
                            <p>When you use an AI feature like receipt scanning, the image is sent to our secure, stateless backend endpoint. This endpoint acts as a proxy, forwarding the image to the AI model for processing and then immediately returning the structured data to your device. The image and its contents are never stored on our servers. This approach allows us to provide powerful AI capabilities without ever compromising the privacy and security of your financial history. Your data remains yours, by design.</p>
